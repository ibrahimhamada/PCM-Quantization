# PCM-Quantization

My Project of the Communications Theory and Systems Course Offered in Spring 2021 @ Zewail City.

In this project, I implemented a GUI to help users quantize an analog discrete signal using PCM QUANTIZATION.

Quantizer function and GUI have the option that the user chooses between:
1) Uniform quantizer, where the user specifies the number of levels, L, the peak quantization level,mp, and whether the quantizer in mid-rise or mid-tread
2) Non-Uniform µ-Law quantizer, where the user specifies µ; L and mp
The GUI allows the user to input a signal to be quantized. That signal will be in the form of two vectors, a time vector and an amplitude vector.
